Project: Logical Gate Circuit and Proof Verification
Overview
In this project, we will create a circuit using the Circom programming language to implement a logical gate and then generate a proof for specific inputs. The goal is to prove that we know the inputs A (0) and B (1) that yield a 0 output. We will use a solidity verifier contract to verify the generated proof on the Goerli Testnet.

Install the required dependencies:


npm install
Compile the Circuit and verify it against a smart contract verifier:

bash

npx hardhat circom
Prove and Deploy the verifier contract:

bash

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
This script performs the following:

Deploys the MultiplierVerifier.sol contract.
Generates a proof from circuit intermediaries with generateProof().
Generates calldata with generateCallData().
Calls verifyProof() on the verifier contract with calldata.
With two commands, you can compile a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), generate a proof, deploy a verifier, and verify the proof! ðŸŽ‰

Configuration
Directory Structure
The circuits directory contains circuit configurations and compiled outputs. The contracts directory contains the autogenerated Verifier contract.

The hardhat.config.ts file includes the circuits configuration.

npx hardhat newcircuit --name newcircuit
Determinism
When recompiling the same circuit using the groth16 protocol, a new final beacon is applied, changing all the zkey output files. To use a deterministic build, set the beacon property in a circuit's config.

Circuit Implementation (circuit.circom)
circom

template LogicGate() {
  // Define the inputs
  signal input A, B;

  // Define the output
  signal output Q;
}

// Component for the Logic Gate
component main = LogicGate();

// Logic to check that Q = A AND NOT B
main.Q <== main.A * (1 - main.B);
Compiling the Circuit
To compile the circuit and generate circuit intermediaries, use Circom:

Generating the Proof
To generate a proof, provide inputs (A=0, B=1) in a witness file (e.g., witness.json) and use snarkjs:

bash

snarkjs wtns calculate circuit.wasm witness.json proof.wtns
snarkjs groth16 prove circuit.ptau proof.wtns proof.json
Solidity Verifier Contract (Verifier.sol)
Write a Solidity contract for verification using Groth16 verification keys. Deploy the Verifier contract to the Goerli Testnet.

solidity

// Import statements for the Groth16 library and other necessary libraries

contract Verifier {
    // Verifier contract logic for proof verification
}
Deploying the Verifier Contract
Deploy the Verifier contract to the Goerli Testnet or any other Ethereum network you prefer. You can use tools like Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix to deploy the contract.

Calling the verifyProof() Method
Write a test script (e.g., test.js) to call the verifyProof() method on the deployed Verifier contract. Assert that the output is true for the given inputs (A=0, B=1).
